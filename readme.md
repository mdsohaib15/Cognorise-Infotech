## **TOUR AND TRAVEL CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION**

- The Tour & Travels Customer Churn Prediction dataset assists a travel company in
predicting customer churn. It includes indicators such as age, frequent flyer status,
annual income class, services opted frequency, social media account
synchronization, and hotel bookings.

used for practice and in a hackathon, is freely available. Analysts can perform
exploratory data analyses to reveal insights for effective churn prediction. The
binary target variable distinguishes customers who churn (1) from those who don't
(0), guiding the modeling process.

# **TASK 3**
## **CUSTOMER PERSONALITY ANALYSIS**

- Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal
customers. It helps a business to better understand its customers and makes it
easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors and
concerns of different types of customers.
- Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its
target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead
of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s
database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy
the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
